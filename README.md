# Automatic-Marker
this is an example branch where the `marking scheme.json` has been setup for 2 modules: `commission.py` and `margin.py`

see `generate_expected/generate_expected.py` to see how the input is ceated

notice in root folder: `commissio.py.txt` and `margin.py.txt`: these are the files with the generated expected output from `generate_expected/generate_expected.py`
    these are kept only as example and may be deleted when contents have been copied into `marking_scheme.json`

minor changes have been made to the files in example_student_submission_not_perfect to demonstrate

to run this example: navigate to `main.py` and hit run, you'll notice text files get created in the student's directories, this is the feedback of the assignment
